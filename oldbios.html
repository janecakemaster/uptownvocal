                  <p><strong>Allison Heimann</strong> aka Allypoo or Alsriff, may spend lots of time with the basses, but actually has the daintiest soprano voice south of 114th St. This jewel in UV's crown comes to the Big Apple from her home in the Cleve and brings with her a love for jazz improvisation, arranging and soloing. She's Uptown's resident Ayn Rand Scholar and always checks her premises... except the premise that everyone is always trying to kiss her. Allison can usually be found outside of Philosophy Hall arguing with Rodin's statue or in Caf&eacute; 212 buying up all the Neuro-trim. Aside from that, you can count on Allison to have three things: rhythm, fever, and eyes for you. Cha chee cha chee cha!</p>

                  <p><strong>Mary Glenn</strong> is Uptown Vocal's prima ballerina. When she's not busy pirouette-ing, playing her cello, or standing in for the MD's pitch pipe, Mary makes gourmet grilled cheese for the student-run, humanitarian organization known as Feel Good, whose profits go towards the World Hunger Project. While this blonde-haired, blue-eyed lady may seem like an angel, her low, sultry bass - cough - sorry, tenor! What? - sorry - ALTO tones suggest a darker side. Even though she often wears socks with cute kittens on them, Mary is a dog person and, in fact, hates cats. She also works as a bartender and babysitter, but not at the same time. Mary is a Spanish and Human Rights major, and hails from Wellesley, MA.</p>

                  <p><strong>Reuben Arnold</strong> is a fabulous tenor in Uptown Vocal! As a econ-political science double major concentrating in history, UV is the jazz-a-licious icing on the cake of his busy academic schedule. His tantalizingly terrific tenor tones can be heard in every song, but he shines on his solo in the classic Duke Ellington tune "Sophisticated Lady" (UV arrangement by Connor Spahn). Reuben hails from the great state of Wisconsin, and before you ask, yes, the cheese really is that good and it really is that cold. While some in the group are hasty to anoint him as future President of the Universe, for the moment he's much happier singing with a bunch of fantastic people in this excellent a capella group.</p>

                  <p><strong>Mikhail Qader</strong> is here to add a whole new flavor to the shrimp-fried gumbo that is Uptown Vocal. Mikhail is the crawfish in our bayou, the beads in our Mardi Gras parade. He’s the cajun spice that’s been missing from our musical jambalaya. It seems that New Orleans, the city that gave birth to Jazz Music, has also given birth to Mikhail, a jazz man the likes of which the world has never seen. In addition to playing the saxophone like he was descended from Charlie Parker himself, Mikhail’s also got that sexy, soulful “Semper-Sub” bass voice that makes all the ladies swoon. </p>
                  
                  <p>But don’t be fooled by his curly black locks and his irresistible swagger, this boy’s got smarts too. He knows his way around all sorts of modal harmonies, multi-tonic changes and tritone substitutions. In fact, it is said that Mikhail has never not known what a tritone substitution is. When he’s not making music, Mikhail is out to to electrify the world with his winning personality (and several 20 Amp DC Power Supplies) as an Electrical Engineer in SEAS.</p>

                  <p><strong>Tareq Abuissa</strong> is the man your man could sing like. Picking out a B flat by ear is like playing whack-a-mole with a manhole cover-to this guy--it's just too easy. But Tareq's musical abilities extend beyond his perfect pitch and angelic voice; he also plays the cello and the piano. Hailing from Iowa City, Iowa to join us, Tareq also goes by his alter ego Ta'areq, the Icelandic Witch-King.</p>

                  <p><strong>Joya Ahmad</strong> hails from the booming metropolis of Philadelphia, but her true home is among the grandness of nature. Joya delights in charming forest animals by humming "Colors of the Wind," picking the Stayman Winesap yaboes growing wild amongst the trees, and offering nesting birds strands of her luscious tresses, themselves the color of a raven's wing. In short: she is Pocahontas. Isolated from her woodland home, Joya has committed herself to improving the world through engineering, hoping one day to create something as magnificent as the Large Hadron Collider (in her own words: "both the largest particle accelerator in the world AND the largest cryogenic facility in the world - double home run!!"), only with more magic in it: in the future, Joya intends to create machines that run on imagination. Until that glorious day, and the resulting Nobel, Joya sings both soprano and alto with UV (she has a stunning range comparable to that of her favorite singer, Regina Spektor).</p>
