<font size="+1">Student Leaves Legacy Of Performance, Wit</font><br>
Dan Laidman <br>
Columbia Daily Spectator <br>
March 27, 2000<br>
<br>
Brian Malmon, a student on leave from Columbia College who wowed audiences with his performances, enlightened readers with
his journalism, and
                 inspired friends with his wit, died last Friday at his
home in Maryland. Police
                 ruled the death a suicide. Malmon, 22, is survived by his
mother, father, and
                 younger sister. <p>

                 Malmon arrived at Columbia in 1995 from Potomac, Md., a
student whom
                 friends remember as bright, kind, and above all
uproariously witty. During his
                 time at Columbia, Malmon sang with the a cappella group
Uptown Vocal,
                 performed in the Varsity Show, and served as Sports
Editor at the Spectator,
                 all the while maintaining a very high grade point
average. </p><p>

                 Malmon's dedication was extraordinary by any measure. He
rose to leadership
                 positions in three major campus activities, and left
those he worked with in awe
                 of his creativity and humor. His friends described him as
"hilariously funny," "funny as hell," "dry and witty," and a "source of
mirth." They also say that
                 underneath the humor was a pain that he kept hidden from
almost everyone
                 around him. </p><p>

                 Sky Spiegel, BC '01, listing all of Malmon's activities,
asked, "How can one
                 person do that?" Spiegel sang with Malmon in Uptown
Vocal. "He was just
                 always someone to look up to, was always selfless, was
completely dedicated." </p><p>

                 Malmon started singing for Uptown Vocal when he came to
Columbia, and
                 became president of the club at the beginning of his
senior year. His colleagues
                 there remember how he infused the group with humor, and
enlivened
                 rehearsals, performances, and group trips with his
presence.  </p><p>

                 Amy Lin, CC '00, the current president of Uptown Vocal,
was good friends
                 with Malmon. She recounted one story from a performance
at NYU, when
                 Malmon spontaneously decided to stage a contest involving
audience
                 participation. He got the crowd to cheer for who they
thought was prettier, the
                 group's female "blond bombshell," or a male singer who
stripped away his
                 trenchcoat to reveal that he was in drag. </p><p>

                 Beyond his sense of humor, Malmon set the tone for the
entire group, Lin said. </p><p>

                 "Everyone just respected him, when he was one of the
first to goof off we'd all
                 follow his lead and goof off, but once he said, `okay
guys, be quiet,' we'd all
                 follow his lead, because he commanded such a respect."</p><p>

                 Malmon joined the Spectator staff as a sports writer
during his first year at
                 Columbia. He soon began penning the irreverent column
"Homerically
                 Speaking" (see back page), and in 1997 became Sports
Editor on the
                 newspaper's 121st Managing Board.  </p><p>

                 "I remember checking my schedule and hoping he would be
on as an editor on
                 my nights," said Sandie Angulo, CC '98, a friend of
Malmon's who was
                 Managing Editor of the Spectator that year. "I remember
laughing the whole
                 night long, even if it was until 5 a.m. He could make
anyone laugh, even the
                 most cynical person."  </p><p>

                 Malmon's sense of humor made a similarly striking
impression on his peers at
                 the Varsity Show. Maurice James, CC '01, was in the cast
with Malmon, and
                 remembers his talent for improvisation.  </p><p>

                 "The material that Brian came up with, you wouldn't
expect it," James said. "It
                 was always like he was in his own world, especially in
terms of his comedy, and
                 when you got glimpses into that world, you were just
like, `wow, that's really
                 funny.'" </p><p>

                 Malmon's elaborate personal website shows off his varied
interests and the
                 dynamic humor that tied them all together. He devotes an
equal amount of
                 space to The Simpsons ("the greatest show on earth [no,
not the circus]"),
                 the band Weezer ("They kick some large ass -- El Scorcho
is beautiful, it
                 makes me weep gently every time I hear it."), and the
Washington Bullets
                 ("the greatest sports team on the planet -- Yes it is true
that they've changed
                 their name to the Wizards, but they'll always be the
Boulez to me"). </p><p>

                 Andy Miara, CC '00, co-wrote that year's Varsity Show,
and was partly
                 responsible for Malmon being cast in the starring role as
the `coolest kid in
                 school.' Of course Malmon was the logical choice for a
singing and dancing
                 star." </p><p>

                 Miara says that in spite of his creative sense of humor,
Malmon could be
                 counted on to provide down to earth advice.  </p><p>

                 "He was the guy I would call when I was having problems
with the show," he
                 said. "He became a sounding board for me to give the
rational response to the
                 craziness that we were going through." </p><p>

                 James sometimes felt alienated as one of only a few
first-years in the cast, and
                 he remembers Malmon, a junior at the time, as one of the
few upperclassmen
                 who approached him and was actively friendly. "I always
appreciated him for
                 that." </p><p>

                 Miara and James both remember a change in Malmon, though,
as the
                 performance drew nearer. They say he had always been
good, but had
                 struggled with his role, until days before the show when
he seemed to get his
                 character down perfectly. Strangely, though, this
creative epiphany coincided
                 with a social withdrawal that disturbed some of those
around him.  </p><p>

                 "He went into this weird funk basically for the duration
of the performances
                 where he was very withdrawn from the cast and out there
on his own," Miara
                 said. "It was the first time I'd ever seen him not be
just Brian Malmon who was
                 together, who was on top of everything." </p><p>

                 James remembers a Varsity Show cast party at which Malmon
surprised
                 everyone by composing and performing an original song
about the behind the
                 scenes wranglings of the Varsity Show.  </p><p>

                 "It was just like Brian because it was completely out of
the blue to bring a guitar
                 to the cast party and sing a song," James said. "And then
right after it he got
                 very sad and stoic, not letting people in with his
feelings."  </p><p>

                 Malmon went on leave from Columbia in the fall term of
1998. He returned
                 home to Maryland, where he kept in sporadic contact with
his friends from
                 Columbia. When Joe Rezek, CC '01, a member of Uptown
Vocal, heard
                 Malmon's message announcing that he would be leaving
school, he thought it
                 was a joke.  </p><p>

                 "It was a total surprise," he said. "In the group we
totally chilled all the time, but
                 I guess I couldn't have been that close to him. In a way
none of us in the group
                 were, we didn't know that he was that upset, he kept it
hidden under his
                 humor."  </p><p>

                 According to his friends, he spent much of his time off
resting and coping with
                 his problems, although at one point he took a job working
for The Washington
                 Post. Last summer, Uptown Vocal invited him to once again
travel to London
                 on the QE2 with them.  </p><p>

                 "He seemed much happier, he was laughing, he was telling
jokes," said Uptown
                 Vocal alumna Judy Kaplan, CC '99. "If he was feeling
terrible, he did a really
                 good job of hiding it, we saw the signs that he was
recovering." </p><p>

                 After the trip, though, he once again fell into a pattern
of only occasionally
                 speaking with friends from Columbia. Kaplan remembers
several times when
                 she would be with groups of his friends and they would
call him and pass the
                 phone around.  </p><p>

                 "He tried to give us good news whenever we talked to
him," she said. "He said
                 he was coming back to school in the spring, or in the
fall."  </p><p>

                 Malmon told several friends over the phone or by e-mail
that he would be
                 returning to Columbia, and for many these correspondences
from him were
                 their last. He took his own life on Friday at his
mother's house in Potomac.
                 According to Joyce Barrows, Public Information Officer
for the Montgomery
                 County Police, Malmon died from a gunshot wound, and left
behind a note.  </p><p>

                 Yesterday, friends and family gathered in his hometown to
come together and
                 celebrate his life. Members of Uptown Vocal past and
present traveled
                 together to Potomac to attend the funeral and comfort
Malmon's family. At
                 Malmon's mother's request, they sang several songs at her
house after the
                 ceremony.  </p><p>

                 On the way back to New York, members of Uptown Vocal
reminisced about
                 their lost friend and mentor. They kept on coming back to
his amazing sense of
                 humor, and they kept on pointing out obscure new talents
that this individual of
                 seemingly limitless gifts possessed. </p><p>

                 "And he could draw," Lin said. "I would look through his
notes, and his
                 doodling would have taken me five hours to draw."

                 They talked about how much he was able to achieve and how
many people he
                 was able to touch in spite of how much pain he must have
been in.  </p><p>

                 "He really put so much toward caring for other people and
dedicating himself to
                 that that he tried to hide anything that was wrong with
him," Spiegel said. 

                 James Brust, CC '97, an Uptown Vocal alumnus who is now
at Columbia
                 medical school, called Malmon "wiser and cooler than his
years." Indeed it is
                 difficult to imagine another individual who at 22 was so
capable of serving so
                 many different functions for so many different people,
who was capable of
                 playing so many different roles. </p><p>

                 "He was always willing to learn from you as well as to
teach you," Lin said.  </p><p>

                 "He was your friend, but at the same time he was your
older brother -- and
                 your younger brother." </p><p>
