It is 11:30 in New Hampshire on a Saturday  <br>
and we are on this road trip up north, <br>
singing for a few dollars at the Portsmouth <br>
Historical Society and we wake up late. <br>
It's been the year 2000 for a while now. <br>
We go downtown and get our picture <br>
taken in Market Square; we drink some <br>
coffee and greet neighborhood dogs and <br>
expect to get to Boston at about 3:00. <br>
 <br>
We walk back to Charles' house where we <br>
stayed last night, all passed out on his living room <br>
floor.  We watch a few cartoons and are on our way. <br>
 <br>
So we get onto I-95 southbound and I call <br>
the group at Boston University we will sing  <br>
with and for once I don't get the answering machine. <br>
They expect a few hundred people <br>
and about five other college groups too. <br>
Sky's driving and the two of us try  <br>
to decide what songs to sing, maybe LET'S DO IT  <br>
or KING OF PAIN, but then we decide  <br>
it's better to start with AUTUMN LEAVES like  <br>
we always do and end with <br>
CALL ME AL. <br> <br>

		We talk about the group next year <br>
and how many basses we'll have and how <br>
many altos we need from the fresh <br>
first years.  We make a few silly faces <br>
at the car in back of us and Sky gets the phone call <br>
 <br>
and starts laughing hysterically but then I see <br>
in view of the mirror that she's all tears <br>
and Dave tries to steer the car to the side <br> 
of the highway and we're sweating and I remember <br>
the message he sent out of the blue last year <br>
telling us he's leaving the group and Columbia and for a while I didn't <br>
    understand. <br>
