        <p class="justify">Uptown Vocal is the premier jazz and pop a cappella group of Columbia University in the city of New York. As we enter our third decade of bringing jazz/pop to the CU community, our repertoire includes major pop hits like Katy Perry's "Teenage Dream" and Adele's "Skyfall", as well as timeless jazz standards such as "Take Five" and "Come Fly With Me".</p>
        <p class="justify">We perform at numerous functions both on and off campus throughout the year and regularly grace other college campuses with our musical talent and unusual attractiveness.</p>

                  <p><strong>Danielle Strassman</strong> spends most of her time taking advantage of the East Coast, a different flavor from her West Coast origins of Los Angeles. When she isn't singing like a diva in rehearsals, she can be found flipping grilled cheese for Columbia University's "Feel Good", an organization that donates its proceeds to help destroy world hunger. As a fellow 'Doctor Who' and 'Buffy' fanatic, Danielle's big voice and even bigger heart complete the UV ensemble.</p>

                  <p><strong>Lizzy Karnaukh</strong> is a beautiful Russian ballerina who is as talented as she is adorable. She is equipped with stellar blending abilities, but her sweet soprano tone graces us with solos as well! She sounds especially zoppity on ballads. Lizzy hails from New Jersey, Uptown Vocal's favorite state. She glows with Princeton pride but absolutely loves her new home here in New York. In her spare time, Lizzy enjoys watching and/or crying over episodes of Doctor Who on Netflix. You can also find her devouring Annie's mac and cheese, giving amazing massages, or humming holiday tunes at any time of year. We love Lizzy and the group wouldn't be the same without her!</p>

                  <p>Hailing from Tampa, Florida, <strong>Betsey Giammattei</strong> is probably more famous than you. With more YouTube hits than Ben Kaplan, she is poised to take over the internet with her original songs, stunning soprano, and--of course--unusual attractiveness. She can also speak Chinese, which will aide her in her quest for international stardom. Before Betsey really blows up, though, the Columbia community will have the privilege of watching her perform, free of charge, for four years. Both a solid group member and a knockout soloist, Betsey is definitely one to watch, and she'll surely keep listeners coming back for more. </p>

                  <p><strong>Jane Kim</strong> Characterized by her hip garb, spontaneous hip-wiggling, curiously wide vocal range and unusual capacities for whimsy, Jane is a sopralto sooner hugged than forgotten. She hails from Tenafly, New Jersey and is at Columbia to study computer science, but when the weather is nice it tends to not involve large lecture halls. Some enthusiasts have suggested that she step up and replace Lady Gaga's musical career altogether. She is the shortest member of Uptown Vocal. <br>Visit her website <a href="http://janekim.me" target="_blank">janekim.me</a></p>

Finland? We may never know. Rachel's interests include being the newest and sultriest member of UV, having a dog who has a PhD, fruit, and being a Well-Woman peer educator over at Barnard, where she talks about women's health issues to other Barnard ladies. Additionally, Rachel thinks "cashews are the devil's work." Listen for her too-cute-to-handle "dooby dooby doo" in Let's Do It and her solo in Ipanema which only suggests that she may in fact be the elusive girl she sings about!</p>

                  <p><strong>Linda Cartolano</strong> is one of Uptown Vocal’s sweetest (and smallest) members. Her cheerful attitude and too-cute smile brighten every UV rehearsal and performance, but don’t be fooled – she sings like a true diva! Her wide range, big voice, and can-do attitude are awesome assets to the alto section. Linda and her many younger siblings come from Eastchester, New York... and after hearing us perform, maybe they’ll even form a sibling a cappella group of their own! Listen for her sassy solo in How Deep is Your Love/Ain’t No Mountain High Enough (UV arrangement by Allison Heimann), and many more to come.</p>

                  <p><strong>Ben Kaplan</strong> is a sassy scatting native New Yorker. He knows all the lyrics to every pop song you know and can belt them in all his tenor glory like it's his job. He also infuses his pop-inspired, omg I-can't-believe-how-accurate-he-is-without-being-autotuned solo voice into some of our classic jazz standards, like Moondance and Moon River, to create a new style called Moon Jazz--the future of music when we colonize the moon. In his spare time, he likes to go yabo-picking and imitate Youtube icons (Kingsley, anyone?). He is one of our number one soloists in Uptown Vocal, and there is never a dull moment with him in the group.</p>

                  <p><strong>Jonathan Dean</strong> aka Jonathan 'Light Blue' Deantini, hails from the cologne section of your favorite Filene's Basement. His buttery tenor falsetto will make you melt (that is, if you're still in solid form after gazing into his steely-crystal eyes.) Though known primarily for his golden pipes, Mr. Dean has a heart of platinum. He's always game to help out his friends, particularly in times of olfactory crisis, and may be counted on even when only one of his arms is working. He's sexy and he knows it-have you heard him sing the Moondance at parties?--but despite being a stand out soloist in a league of his own, he's one of the smoothest and blendiest members of the group, and we wouldn't be complete without him!</p>

                  <p><strong>Michael Gildin,</strong> as though willed by Vulcan, has smoothly wedded himself to the precious alloy that is Semper Sub. The lusters of his precise base lines and molten pelvic gestures have solidified the Bass Section (previously in flux), and enhanced its conductivity in terms of heat, electricity, and sexual magnetism. A truly noble metal, his musical talents allow him to excel in many extra-UVicular activities, but with great aplumbum, Mg makes his schedule ever malleable for the sake of Uptown Vocal. Michael is always on the next level. Known for his classy disposition and occasional knife wielding, never let him catch you saying that the party is cooling off, because he will promptly inform you that it is yet to begin. He came from Pennsylvania to study Political Science and Pre-Med at Columbia College, but what many don't know is that he is also a Jazz Pianist Extraordinaire. If you walk by John Jay Lounge at the right time of day, you just might hear a masterful jazz standard or two compliments of Michael Gildin. Above all else, however, he is a treasured member of Uptown Vocal and a welcome addition to Semper Sub. Michael is the greatest human being ever.</p>

                  <p><strong>Devin Wright</strong>, aka Devicakes, is from the idyllic hamlet of Mahopac, NY. He plans to study physics and math. A true renaissance man, he's broken the nerdy/sexy dichotomy, as he enjoys the best out of both worlds. He aspires to Aristotle's axiom that "the mark of an educated mind [is] to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it." Hence, he entertains himself with nerdy webcomics like xkcd.com. In his spare time, he plays the cello, writes music, and travels to Time Square at 3AM like any true New Yorker should.</p>

                  <p><strong>Gabriel Blanco</strong> joins UV from a point precisely equidistant from Venezula, Switzerland, and Cincinnati. His extremely fresh bass singing is matched only by his superhuman mastery of electricity, which will only grow as he continues his study of Electrical Engineering. He cultivates the intersections between his engineering knowledge and love of music, and he is currently designing an innovative effects pedal which makes a guitar sound like a vocal jazz group. Gabe is not only a bass but an electric bassist; indeed, fans and critics alike claim to hear a hint of the instrument's powerful rumble as Gabe sings.</p>

Ray enjoys reading and translating Classical Literature, especially the murder parts, and running in the park wearing a purple bandana (watch out for this). While his countenance can be intimidating and his muscles fearsome, Ray is a sweet fellow who engages in many gentle pursuits, including violin, piano, and writing poetry in various classical meters. He is definitely NOT a murderer. Ray can be found in the gym, in Ferris Booth eating up all the biscuits, or in his room watching anime. No matter the time or weather, Ray always has a smile on his face, a song in his heart, and hip glasses on his face. (Ray is a non-murderer.)</p>

The villa is actual a hidden base of operations where she can lead her double life as Nikita, a jet-setting secret agent. Who also steals diamonds.</p>
